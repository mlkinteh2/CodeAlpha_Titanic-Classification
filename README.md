# CodeAlpha_Titanic-Classification
# Survival Prediction System
This repository contains the project completed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha. The project involves creating a system that predicts whether a person would survive under certain circumstances based on multiple factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other relevant variables.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze various factors that influence survival probabilities and develop a system capable of making predictions based on these inputs. This system leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of survival and identify the most critical factors that contribute to success.

## Features

- **Survival Prediction**: Predicts whether an individual is likely to survive based on input data.
- **Key Factor Analysis**: Highlights the factors that are most influential in determining survival chances.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual representations of the relationships between variables and survival outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used includes variables such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. These were sourced from reliable repositories or simulated to mimic real-world scenarios.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and encoding the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and selecting key features that significantly affect survival probabilities.
4. **Model Building**: Developing and training machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Testing the model's accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization




## Key Findings
## Gender:
A significantly higher proportion of females survived compared to males. This suggests that gender played a crucial role in survival decisions during the Titanic disaster.

## Socio-Economic Status (Pclass):
Passengers in Pclass 1 (upper class) had a much higher survival rate compared to those in Pclass 3 (lower class). This indicates socio-economic status influenced access to lifeboats.

## Age:
Children had a higher survival rate compared to adults and seniors, reflecting the "women and children first" policy.

## Port of Embarkation (Embarked):
Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) had a slightly higher survival rate compared to other ports.

## Future Improvements

- Integrating additional variables to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Deploying the system as a web application for broader accessibility.
- Incorporating real-time data processing capabilities.

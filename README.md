# Survival Prediction System
This repository contains the project completed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha. The project involves creating a system that predicts whether a person would survive under certain circumstances based on multiple factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other relevant variables.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze various factors that influence survival probabilities and develop a system capable of making predictions based on these inputs. This system leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of survival and identify the most critical factors that contribute to success.

## Features

- **Survival Prediction**: Predicts whether an individual is likely to survive based on input data.
- **Key Factor Analysis**: Highlights the factors that are most influential in determining survival chances.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visual representations of the relationships between variables and survival outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used includes variables such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. These were sourced from reliable repositories or simulated to mimic real-world scenarios.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and encoding the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and selecting key features that significantly affect survival probabilities.
4. **Model Building**: Developing and training machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Testing the model's accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/survival-prediction-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd survival-prediction-system
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Input the required data into the system via the user interface or input files.
2. The system processes the data and predicts the likelihood of survival.
3. Review the results and insights provided, including key factors influencing the outcome.

## Key Findings

- Factors such as **socio-economic status**, **age**, and **gender** significantly impact survival outcomes.
- Younger individuals with higher socio-economic status were more likely to survive.

## Future Improvements

- Integrating additional variables to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Deploying the system as a web application for broader accessibility.
- Incorporating real-time data processing capabilities.
